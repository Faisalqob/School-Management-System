# School Management System

A simple, command-line-based C++ School Management System for handling basic student and teacher information. This program allows users to add students and teachers, view student records, and display teacher information. It uses object-oriented programming principles with a modular class design for easy management.

## Features

- **Add Students**: Create a new student profile, assign an ID, and add basic details.
- **Add Teachers**: Create a new teacher profile, assign a unique ID, and add subject specialization.
- **Display Student Records**: View academic records of all students, including grades and course details.
- **Display Teacher Information**: View information on each teacher, including subject specialization and ID.
